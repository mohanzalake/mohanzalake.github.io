I am selected to participate in the [Faculty Entrepreneurial Leadership Program (FELP)](https://today.uic.edu/call-for-nominations-2023-inaugural-ui-faculty-entrepreneurial-leadership-program/). FELP is an enhancement to the University of Illinois’ entrepreneurial ecosystem that aims to support entrepreneurship-oriented faculty in their development as entrepreneurs across its three campuses. The program will help enhance faculty entrepreneurship knowledge and self-efficacy, seed new venture creation, and develop a diverse and inclusive community of entrepreneurial faculty.
