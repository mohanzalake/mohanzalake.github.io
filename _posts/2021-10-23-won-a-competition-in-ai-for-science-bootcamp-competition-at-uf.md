I along with my team consisting of 4 other Ph.D. students from the UF CISE department recently participated in the HyperGator AI (supercomputer at UF) for Science Bootcamp, co-organized by personals from NVIDIA and UF. I am very excited to share that our team won one of the AI for Science Bootcamp competitions! This was my first time attending an AI Bootcamp and I am glad that UF selected me for participating in this opportunity. I am looking forward to leveraging the knowledge gained from this Bootcamp in my future research endeavors related to designing AI-driven personalized virtual agents.
