I joined the Biomedical and Health Information Sciences (BHIS) Department at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) as a Research Assistant Professor.

I will be conducting research on the use of technologies across the Reality-Virtuality spectrum, such as Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR), to develop virtual healthcare experiences. Students interested in conducting research in any of following fields: Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Intelligent Virtual Agents, Human-Computer Interaction, Adaptive Technologies, Health Behavior Change, can contact me at [zalake@uic.edu](zalake@uic.edu).
