**Goals**

The goal of the project was to develop an virtual human-based suicidal health intervention to reduce suicide and readmission of suicidal patients.  

**Approach**

1. **User-centered Design Process**

   The design process involved iterative prototyping with continuous user-testing. The development phase involved low and high fidelity prototypes to test and refine ideas.
