### **Goals**

The goal of the project was to develop an virtual human-based suicidal health intervention to reduce suicide and readmission of suicidal patients.  

### **Collaborators**

Suicidologists, Therapists, Psychologists

### My Role as Virtual Agent Researcher

My role in the project was to: 

1) provide virtual agent domain knowledge for non-computer science experts. I helped team understand best-practices for designing agent-based health intervention based on prior literature on virtual agents and my prior experience of developing virtual agents. 

2) develop and iterate prototypes based on user feedback during iterative prototyping. 

### **Target Audience**

Suicidal Patients

### **Technology Used**

Balsamiq and InVision for low and high-fidelity prototyping.

Unity, C#, Web Technologies for interactive prototype.

### **Approach**

1. #### **User-centered Design Process**

   The design process involved iterative prototyping with continuous user-testing. The development phase involved low and high fidelity prototypes to test and refine ideas.

2. #### **Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model.**

   Kirkpatrick evaluation model was used to identify evaluation metrics.

### User Testing

The system was evaluated with 24 suicidal patients during iterative prototyping.

### Results

Users found virtual intervention via tablets acceptable. Users also found interaction with "virtual doctor" to be easy to use, helpful, and entertaining.
