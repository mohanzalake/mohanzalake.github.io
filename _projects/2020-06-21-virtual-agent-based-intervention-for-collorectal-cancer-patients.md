### **Goals**

The goal of the project was to develop a virtual agent-based health intervention to reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) risk by increasing colorectal cancer screening in patients.

### **Collaborators**

Physicians, Communication Scientists, Community members.

### My Role as Virtual Agent and User Experience Researcher

My role in the project was to: 

1. provide virtual agent domain knowledge for non-computer science experts. I helped team understand best-practices for designing agent-based health intervention based on prior literature on virtual agents and my prior experience of developing virtual agents. 
2. develop and iterate prototypes based on user feedback during iterative prototyping. 
3. develop a web-based system to deliver the intervention for 3000+ users for pilot and clinical studies.

### **Target Audience**

At-Risk Colorectal Cancer Patients

### **Technology Used**

Balsamiq for low-fidelity prototyping.

Unity, C#, Web Technologies for interactive system.

### **Approach**

1. #### **User-centered Design Process**

   The design process involved iterative prototyping with continuous user-testing. The development phase involved low and high fidelity prototypes to test and refine ideas.
2. #### **Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model.**

   Kirkpatrick evaluation model was used to identify evaluation metrics.

### User Testing

The system has been evaluated with **3000+ patients** during pilot studies and is currently in clinical trials.

### Results

* Virtual agents can influence user intentions to change health-related behavior outside the lab setting.
* Virtual agent messages can be made personally relevant to users by identifying the structure of the message
  using qualitative methods such as focus groups and interviews with target population.
* Virtual agents tailored to individual differences such as userâ€™s race and gender have shown promising
  results in influencing user health-related intentions to change behavior.
