With current advances in 3D graphics on the web and Internet speeds, the use of web-based conversational virtual humans has shown great potential to improve population health. Prior work has shown that virtual humans are effective in promoting positive health behaviors. They enable face-to-face conversations like a real human while maintaining anonymity for users in difficult conversations. As they are deployed via the web, they can be standardized and targeted to large populations at reduced costs.

However, **the development of virtual humans often requires computer science expertise, which makes the adoption of virtual human technology challenging for non-computer science experts.** The time, cost, and expertise required to develop and deploy virtual humans on the web can lead experts from non-computer science domains to avoid virtual human technology. To increase the adoption of virtual human technology in different domains, a system called Virtual Interviewer Platform (VIP) has been developed.

**VIP enables the rapid development of conversational virtual humans and allows users to interact with virtual humans via web browsers.** To generate a virtual human interaction, the domain experts have to write a conversational script. The conversational script is then used by VIP to generate a web link wherein users can interact with a virtual human. The user interaction with a virtual human is saved by the system for later analysis. The VIP system is capable of multiple interaction modalities, including multiple-choice buttons and free-text.
